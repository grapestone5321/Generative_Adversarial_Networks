## Autoencoders

In this lesson we're covering autoencoders. These models are used to compress data, as well as image denoising, which you'll be implementing in this lesson. 

The idea here is we'll build a network that tries to generate it's input data, but with a narrow hidden layer that serves as a compressed representation of the input data.
